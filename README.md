# Xiotim :: Website

This is the GitHub Repository for the Xiotim Website. This basically just for the web - it is a working demo not that far off - haven't replaced it with my one pictures but I coded it by hand.

All Done in HTML, CSS and under 50 lines of JavaScript.


## Run Locally

Clone the project and run it on XAMPP (PS: I would recommend having a locally hosted domain for this step. ~ makes it more satisfying...)

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/xio-tim/xiotim
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd xiotim
```

Install XAMPP (via choclatey)

```bash
  choclatey install xampp
```

Start the server with a command

```bash
  [Directory]/[ServerName]/apache-start.bat
```


## Roadmap

- Not really much, just implemented Portfolio

- Browser support for the Big Three (Chrome, Firefox, (Edge & Safari) - Gecko)

- Written by Hand

- Written full in the main three front-end languages. HTML, CSS & Javascript.

- Student Graduation cap as FavIcon.

## FAQ

#### Is there anything I can send for you to add?

Yeah! But for now we may be closed - because this is the Xiotim website - but later on when we actually get our own website we will just continue adding on this to make it the ultimate template for starters. 

PS: The contact part doesn't work just placeholder.

#### Can I host this?

Definately! I am not really sure for WAMP as last time because most of the experience I have with it is negative (NGL!). So I recommend XAMPP because about ~6 years of using it and no complains. As usual I reccomend a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzucEZh4_no).
